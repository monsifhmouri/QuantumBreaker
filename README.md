## 🚨 What is QuantumBreaker?

`QuantumBreaker` is a **tactical exploit** targeting authentication vulnerabilities in modern web platforms.  
It uses a combination of:

- 🧬 JWT Quantum forging
- 🛰️ Header Smuggling

- 🧿 Session impersonation

This is **not a scanner**, not a brute force tool. This is **surgical precision**.
